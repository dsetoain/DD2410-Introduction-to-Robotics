# Intro to Robotics

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the DD2410 Introduction to Robotics course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The assignments explore core robotics concepts including robot kinematics, path planning, mapping, and system integration. Each assignment demonstrates a practical application of theoretical knowledge, structured to simulate real-world robotics problems.

# Assignments
